### Diamond
Diamond is a type of carbon that forms a hard crystal structure. It's different from graphite, another form of carbon, because it stays solid at room temperature and doesn't easily change into graphite. Diamonds are super tough and great at conducting heat, which makes them useful for cutting and polishing tools. They're also handy in diamond anvil cells, helping scientists mimic the intense pressures deep within the Earth.

### Dataset
This dataset comprises the prices and various characteristics of nearly 54,000 diamonds. It's an excellent resource for machine learning, as well as for data analysis and visualization projects.

#### Dataset Columns

- price : price in US dollars ( $326 - $18,823 )

- carat : weight of the diamond ( 0.2 - 5.01 )

- cut : quality of the cut ( Fair , Good , Very Good , Premium , Ideal )

- color : diamond colour, from J ( worst ) to D ( best )

- clarity : a measurement of how clear the diamond is ( I1 (worst) ,SI2 ,SI1 ,VS2 ,VS1 ,VVS2 ,VVS1 ,IF (best))

- x : length in mm ( 0 - 10.74 )

- y : width in mm ( 0 - 58.9 )

- z : depth in mm ( 0 - 31.8 )

- depth : total depth percentage = z / mean( x, y ) = 2 * z / ( x + y ) --> ( 43 - 79 )

- table : width of top of diamond relative to widest point ( 43 - 95 )

### Algorithms :

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
